                                            Online banking app

Design and implement a persistence layer for online banking app.
The application can store user information, like first name, last name, birthday, passport number and tax number.
Each user can have one or more bank cards.
A bank cards has a number, expiration day, cvv2 (card verification value), and a balance.
Each card should be associated with some user. Each payment made by user is also stored in the application.
A payment holds an information about an amount of money spent, a card that was used to make a payment, and a time when it was done.
-   An application provides the following functionality:
        -   to see all payments made by user a certain day
        -   to load all payments that were made using a certain card
        -   to find all payments that exceeds a given amount
